          <p>Black garlic is a type of aged garlic whose browning is attributable
            to Maillard reaction rather than caramelized, first used as a food
            ingredient in Asian cuisine. It is made by heating whole bulbs of
            garlic (<em>Allium sativum</em>) over the course of several weeks, a
            process that results in black cloves. The taste is sweet and syrupy
            with hints of balsamic vinegar or tamarind. Black garlic's popularity
            has spread to the United States as it has become a sought-after
            ingredient used in high-end cuisine.</p>
          <p>In Korea, black garlic was developed as a health product and it is
            still perceived as such. It is sometimes added to energy drinks, and
            in Thailand is claimed to increase the consumer's longevity. It is
            also used to make black garlic chocolate.</p>
          <p>Black garlic is made when heads of garlic are aged under specialized
            conditions of heat and humidity. Bulbs are kept in a
            humidity-controlled environment at temperatures that range from 60
            to 77 °C (140 to 170 °F) for 60 to 90 days. There are no additives,
            preservatives, or burning of any kind. The enzymes that give fresh
            garlic its sharpness break down. Those conditions are thought to
            facilitate the Maillard reaction, the chemical process that produces
            new flavour compounds responsible for the deep taste of seared meat
            and fried onions. The cloves turn black and develop a sticky date-like
            texture.<br />Bacterial endophytes capable of fermentation and with
            a strong ability of heat resistance have been identified in common in
            garlic and black garlic. These may have relevance to black garlic
            production.</p>
